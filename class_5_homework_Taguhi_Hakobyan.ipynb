    "- _After the code is set, the codebreaker has a fixed number of guesses to break it._\n",
    "- _One turn consists of a guess (a possible code consisting of 4 colors) by the codebreaker and the answer of the codemaker in which he specifies two numbers: how many colors are correct but not in the right place and how many colors are correct and in the right place._\n",

We have provided the names of the helper functions and docstrings about what they should do. Your task is to write the code for each and also to finish the `play_the_game()` function. \n",

    "After completing each function use `assert` to check if your function is doing the right thing. Think about some input cases and the output you expect for each and test if it's the same as the output of you function. Try to catch different inputs that can generate different type of errors. An example test case for `check_input()` function is provided for you. Don't use this method to test the `generate_secret()`, `graphic()` and `play_the_game()` functions."
